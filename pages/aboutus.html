<div id="about">
	<p>Liberty Movement Radio was born in 2010 as the brainchild of Eric Pitts during Ron Paul's revolutionary presidential campaign.  Before retiring into the hands of Margaret Cecile, LMR had already grown up into a passionate community filled with energetic activists who shared a common dream of liberty, dashed with hope, and a drive for truth.  Then the dark night came and the air fell silent.  Rumors abound speculated its disappearance.  Some said it had been kidnapped while others believed it had simply run away.  Missing posters suggested hope may still be alive, yet there was still no word.  Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock.  The air was thick, the anticipation was hot, and just when the last bit of light began to fade something moved in the shadows.  It was LMR, lying on the ground, barely breathing with a slow and labored pulse.  As Margaret nursed LMR back to health its light began to shine again.  In no time it was almost feeling like its former self again, but it knew its mysterious journey into the unknown made that impossible.  It had seen and learned much during its travels and it brought with it new experiences and new knowledge about truth, liberty, and life.  No, nothing was going to be the same again.  However, like all creatures that grow from their experiences over the ages, LMR had evolved.  This new leap in evolution thrust LMR forward into its own personal revolution.  No, nothing is going to be the same ever again.  It's going to be better.  Yes.  The passion is stronger, the dream is bigger, hope has been defeated by faith, and the drive for truth just got an engine upgrade and better gas mileage.  Thanks to Margaret, LMR has been given a fresh new start on an ancient path towards truth and liberty.</p>
